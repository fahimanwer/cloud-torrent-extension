# cloud-torrent-extension  

A mozilla browser extension to directly add magnet links to [Cloud-Torrent](https://github.com/jpillora/cloud-torrent) or [Simple-Torrent](https://github.com/boypt/simple-torrent) server.

When users click right on a magnet link, there will be an option in the browser's context menu and clicking on it will send magnet link to Cloud Torrent which is specified in the setting.
